# AUT Internship Report

This repository contains the code and documentation for a simple Human Resource Management System, developed as part of a university internship project in Summer 2021. The system aims to streamline HR processes and improve employee management within an organization.

## Problem Statement

Managing human resources efficiently and effectively is crucial for organizations of all sizes. The existing manual HR processes often involve significant paperwork, repetitive tasks, and potential errors. This project addresses these challenges by providing a digital solution for HR management, automating key processes, and centralizing employee information.

## System Analysis

The initial phase of the project involved analyzing the requirements and identifying key functionalities. A detailed analysis was conducted to understand the scope, goals, and constraints of the HR system. This analysis helped in defining the system's functionalities and designing an optimal solution.

## System Design

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The ERD was designed to depict the relationships between various entities in the HR system, including employees, departments, positions, and other relevant entities. It provides a visual representation of the database structure and helps in understanding the data model.

### Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

The DFD illustrates the flow of data within the HR system, showing how information is captured, processed, and distributed across different components. It helps identify key processes, data inputs, and outputs, enabling a better understanding of system functionality.

### Use Case Diagram

The Use Case Diagram showcases the interactions between system actors (such as HR managers, employees, and administrators) and the HR system. It outlines various use cases, representing specific actions or tasks that can be performed within the system.

### Activity Diagram

The Activity Diagram demonstrates the flow of activities and decision points within the HR system, capturing the sequential and parallel steps involved in different processes. It provides an overview of how activities are performed and how control flows within the system.

### Sequence Diagram

The Sequence Diagram showcases the interactions and message exchanges between different components of the HR system over time. It helps visualize the dynamic behavior of the system, illustrating the order of message exchanges and the resulting system actions.

### Class Diagram

The Class Diagram represents the static structure of the HR system, highlighting the classes, their attributes, and relationships. It provides a blueprint for designing and implementing the system's object-oriented architecture.

## System Implementation

The HR system was developed using PHP, HTML, and JavaScript to create an interactive and user-friendly web-based application. The system incorporates best practices in web development, adhering to coding standards, security measures, and scalability considerations.
